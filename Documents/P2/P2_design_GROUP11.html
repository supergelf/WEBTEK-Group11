            <h2>Administrative Details</h2>
            <p>Our imaginary client is a bowling alley/ recreation center called Bowlorama.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
            <p>Our purpose for the website is to make everyones bowling experience as simple as possible. </p>
            <p>We want to establish an easy platform for those who want to enjoy a good round of bowling with friends and family.</p>
            <p>The website will make it possible for visitors to book bowling alleys and pool tables, therefore making it easier for people to plan their actiieties beforehand.</p>
            <p>The audience of the website are people who want to book a bowling alley, either for a small group of people, or a larger one like a birthday party. They will have the option to choose how many alleys, and if they plan on eating there as well. <br> The bowling alley also includes a section for playing pool, so people that are interested in that will be able to book pool tables.</p>
            <p>The alley is marketed towards all ages with a particular emphasis on ages 13-20</p>

            <h2>Navigation Structure</h2>
            <img src="./Tankekart.PNG" alt="Map of navigation Structure" id="tankekart">
        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
            <p>Our layout, color-wise, consists of a white background with a red footer and navbar. We chose white as the background color because it works as a great contrast to almost every color a div, and image or text might have. This helps to separate different sections, and improves readability. The white background makes the red «pop» more than it does by itself, which makes for a sleek design. The white and red color combination of our site can also be seen on the classic bowling pins, which goes nicely with our establishment's theme of bowling. The reason we chose two colors for our page and not more, is too keep everything nice and simple, and not make the page too noisy and distracting for the viewer. More colors could also possibly be confusing for people affected by color blindness, who may see these colors as the same, and not get the contrast we had in mind. This is one step in our goal for universal design.</p>
            <p>Text-wise we use a black as our font color for when the background is white, and white when the background is red. This came naturally, since we felt these color combinations created the most contrast, and therefore the most readability. Our font type will be «Verdana». This font is widely supported by different browsers. It's also a font type in the «sans-serif» group, which means it does not have extending features called serif at the end of strokes. The usage of a «sans-serif» font creates a simplistic design, which is easily readable even for small font sizes. Our smallest font is at 18 px, which is used both in the footer and in the paragraphs. We felt as this gave enough space, while also being easy to read without having to zoom in. Second up is our size of the navbar and footer headings at 24 px. The footer headings gave enough contrast in size for the under-text, and the headings in the navbar was evenly placed throughout, while also having a calming space between them. The main headings in the body has a font size of 54 px and the subheadings has a size of 35 px. We wanted a big heading people were naturally gravitated towards. We also wanted a contrast in size between the main headings, subheadings and the paragraphs, creating a tidy layout and a clear separation of the different elements on the site.</p>
            <p>Every page shares the same footer at the bottom and navbar at the top. A navbar at the top is the norm, and where the user expects it to be. Our attention naturally gravitates towards the top of the page, which makes for a great position for an important navigation service. The information found in the footer (contact info, address and opening hours), which can also be found by using the navbar, isn't as important for the user experience, which is why we found the bottom to be a fitting position. Both the navbar and footer have the «Bowl-o-rama» logo, so that the user are familiar with which establishment's website they are exploring. The footer also has icons for telephone and email, so that the user can easily locate where numbers and email adresses are.</p>
        </div>

        <div id="content">
            <h2>Content</h2>
            <p>All areas in gray will be switched with images. (Logo, events etc..)</p>

            <h3>Homepage</h3>
            <div>
                <img src="/Documents/P2/site-mockups/homepage.png" alt="homepage-mockup">
                <p>The hompage represents the website as a whole, and is the landing page of all visitors. It is simple in its design and makes it easy to navigate the site, and to understand what the page is about. <br>
                It contains a header with the bowling alley logo (gray circle), and a navbar to access all the other pages of the website. <br> 
                Further down under the header is a heading and a short intro to what Bowl-O-rama is all about. The "What we offer" section highlights all the different things the bowling alley offers, like events, birthday parties etc. <br>
                The last part of the page is the footer. The footer contains the logo (gray circle), the opening hours, phone number and email address (small gray circles), and the physical address of the bowling alley.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Prices</h3>
            <div>
                <img src="/Documents/P2/site-mockups/prices.png" alt="prices-mockup">
                <p>The prices page's job is to easily inform the visitor about the price ranges of Bowl-O-Rama. The overall design is quite similar to the homepage, though the header is made smaller to set the visitors focus on the information the page presents. The logo works as a hyperlink back to the homepage. <br>
                The page is supposed to describe the prices of bowling alleys and pool tables.
                It will describe how the price changes if you rent more than one alley and the cost per round. The pool tables prices will inform about the prices of renting per hour (and not per round as the bowling alleys). Next to the prices are some images of bowling balls and pool tables to make the page more interesting. <br>
                The bottom of the page contains the exact same footer as the homepage.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Reservation</h3>
            <div>
                <img src="/Documents/P2/site-mockups/reservation.png" alt="prices-mockup">
                <p>The reservation page task is to make it possible for visitors to book bowling alleys and tables in advance of their visit to the bowling alley.
                <br> The header has the same design as the prices page, for the same reasons. <br>
                The main section consists of the reservation form where visitors fill out things like name, email, date, boowling or pool, etc. The form is minimalistic in design and easy to navigate. It also includes a "Special requirements" so that the bowling alley can prepare for people with disabilities for example. At the bottom of the form is a large submit button, which is easy to locate. <br>
                The footer is identical to the other pages.</p>
            </div>

            <h3>Menu</h3>
            <div>
                <img src="/Documents/P2/site-mockups/menu.png" alt="prices-mockup">
                <p>The menu page exist to inform the visitors of what food may be bought at the bowling alley. This makes planning in advance even easier for visitors because they now know that they dont need to find somewhere to eat before or after bowling, they can just do both in one place. <br>
                The header is of the same design as the other pages, except the homepage. Having identical designs spanning several pages makes it easy for the visitor to understand the navigation structure of the site. <br>
                The page shows Bowl-O-ramas selection of pizzas, burgers and sides in a clear and consise way. <br>
                The footer is identical to the other pages.</p>

            <div>

                <p>The events page contaains information about upcoming events taking place in the bowling alley. This is a nice way to grow a bowling community in the area where Bowl-O-rama  resides, and putting that information on a website makes it easy for anyone to be up to date on whats going on at the alley. <br>
                The events are organized in order from the closest to today at the top, to the later ones further down. All the event boxes consists of the name of the event, some information about the event, a background image relating to each event, and a timer displaying how many days, hours and minutes until the event is active. <br>
