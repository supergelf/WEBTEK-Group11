            <h2>Purpose, goals and audience</h2>
            <p>Our purpose for the website is to make everyones bowling experience as simple as possible. </p>
            <p>We want to establish an easy platform for those who want to enjoy a good round of bowling with friends and family.</p>
            <p>The website will make it possible for visitors to book bowling alleys and pool tables, therefore making it easier for people to plan their actiieties beforehand.</p>
            <p>The audience of the website are people who want to book a bowling alley, either for a small group of people, or a larger one like a birthday party. They will have the option to choose how many alleys, and if they plan on eating there as well. <br> The bowling alley also includes a section for playing pool, so people that are interested in that will be able to book pool tables.</p>
            <p>The alley is marketed towards all ages with a particular emphasis on ages 13-20</p>

            <h2>Page Layout and Appearance</h2>
            <p>Our layout, color-wise, consists of a white background with a red footer and navbar. We chose white as the background color because it works as a great contrast to almost every color a div, and image or text might have. This helps to separate different sections, and improves readability. The white background makes the red «pop» more than it does by itself, which makes for a sleek design. The white and red color combination of our site can also be seen on the classic bowling pins, which goes nicely with our establishment's theme of bowling. The reason we chose two colors for our page and not more, is too keep everything nice and simple, and not make the page too noisy and distracting for the viewer. More colors could also possibly be confusing for people affected by color blindness, who may see these colors as the same, and not get the contrast we had in mind. This is one step in our goal for universal design.</p>
            <p>Text-wise we use a black as our font color for when the background is white, and white when the background is red. This came naturally, since we felt these color combinations created the most contrast, and therefore the most readability. Our font type will be «Verdana». This font is widely supported by different browsers. It's also a font type in the «sans-serif» group, which means it does not have extending features called serif at the end of strokes. The usage of a «sans-serif» font creates a simplistic design, which is easily readable even for small font sizes. Our smallest font is at 18 px, which is used both in the footer and in the paragraphs. We felt as this gave enough space, while also being easy to read without having to zoom in. Second up is our size of the navbar and footer headings at 24 px. The footer headings gave enough contrast in size for the under-text, and the headings in the navbar was evenly placed throughout, while also having a calming space between them. The main headings in the body has a font size of 54 px and the subheadings has a size of 35 px. We wanted a big heading people were naturally gravitated towards. We also wanted a contrast in size between the main headings, subheadings and the paragraphs, creating a tidy layout and a clear separation of the different elements on the site.</p>
            <p>Every page shares the same footer at the bottom and navbar at the top. A navbar at the top is the norm, and where the user expects it to be. Our attention naturally gravitates towards the top of the page, which makes for a great position for an important navigation service. The information found in the footer (contact info, address and opening hours), which can also be found by using the navbar, isn't as important for the user experience, which is why we found the bottom to be a fitting position. Both the navbar and footer have the «Bowl-o-rama» logo, so that the user are familiar with which establishment's website they are exploring. The footer also has icons for telephone and email, so that the user can easily locate where numbers and email adresses are.</p>
