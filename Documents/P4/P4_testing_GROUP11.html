            <h2>Testing Document</h2>
            <p>Our questionnaire consisted of a few specific questions and a few more broad ones.</p>
            <p>The questions went like this:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>What age group are you part of?</li>
                <li>What thoughts do you have regarding the navigation of the site?</li>
                <li>What did you think of the layout on the different pages?</li>
                <li>What do you think could be improved/ done differently?</li>
                <li>What did you like about the wesite?</li>
            </ol>
            <br>

            <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
            <p>Since our focus audience for the website were in the 13-20 age range, it was not very difficult to find someone to test the site, since we ourselves know people in that age group. We did also get feedback from ages a bit older than that, since we felt it was important to also get feedback from people that are not as used to technology as young people are.</p>
            <p>Age ranges and a approximation of testers in percent:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>10-25: 63%</li>
                <li>26-35: 24%</li>
                <li>36-55: 13%</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Most of our testing were done live with us observing the tester. This was much more rewarding than just using the form, as we got more info by picking up the testers first impressions to every site and functionality. We were also able to observe what the tester thought about our layout and page scaling first hand. Observing live gave us more "raw" information, since we could be totally sure that this was their actual first impressions. The ones we got to observe live were in the 10-25 age range, as these were people we could easily get in touch with and meet to test our site.</p>

            <h2>Feedback Summary</h2>
            <h3>Navigation</h3>
            <p>All the users thought that navigation was easy and well implemented. They felt that the navbar stood out clearly from the rest of the page as they scrolled. The header being sticky was well recieved by every user we saw live, and by people filling out the form.</p>
            <p>One of the testers did however point out that when the page was scaled a bit down, the space between the links to reservation and menu became a little too narrow compared to the space between the other links.</p>
            <p>One other critisism we got from several testers about navigation was the "What We Offer" section on the homepage. The feedback stated that they wish to be able to click on the cards and be taken to pages fitting the cards description and title, especially the cards describing certain pages on the site.</p>

            <h3>Design and Layout</h3>
            <p>We got mostly positive feedback about the design and layout of the page. Testers thought that the color choices were good and that the pages scaled well to smaller screen sizes. We recieved the most positive feedback regarding the events pages layout the events design and the countdown timers, as well as the changing images on the about page. Some users mentioned that the scaling of each event was well done. We also recieved comments saying that they liked the hover effect on the navbar links.</p>
            <p>Most of the negative feedback we got about design and layout was the forms. Several testers felt that the reservation form was too large, and that it should have been design to fit the whole form on the screen at the same time. We also recieved the same feedback regarding the contact form.</p>
            <p>One user commented that the scrollbar for the pizza and burger sections were too far off from the design of the rest of the page, and that they should be red or white, as well as being rounder to fit the rest of the design better. Another user felt that the items should each have the ingredients for the food listed.</p>
            <p>Several users said that the address in the footer should have a navigation icon like the one on the contact page, to better fit in with the phonenumber and email, as they had icons.</p>

            <h3>Usability</h3>
            <p>Several users commented that the email and address in the footer, should have been clickable and linked straight to an email service and google maps. The users felt the same way about the same elements on the contact page.</p>
            <p>As mentioned in the navigation feedback, testers mentioned that the cards on the hompage should have been clickable.</p>
            <p>Most users commented that they thought the functionality of the reservation form was well implemented, and worked as it should.</p>
            <p>Some users felt that the images in the merch section should not opened another tab, but instead gotten bigger on the same page, while the background got darker.</p>

            <h2>Our Response</h2>
            <h3>Regarding Navigation</h3>
            <p>We understand the critisism we got regarding the header and the cards on the homepage, and when pointed out to us, we completely agree. The space between the reservation and menu is too narrow at one point, and could be fixed by updating the media query to change the layout at a bigger viewport than how it is now.</p>
            <p>The problem with the cards not being interactive could be fixed by linking each card to correlating pages, and adding a hover effect to the cards. We feel that these critisisms are well rooted and should be implemented if the Bowl-O-Rama page were ever to launch online.</p>

            <h3>Regarding Design and Layout</h3>
            <p>The critisism we recieved regarding the reservation and contact form are understandable and should definitely be implemented. It would be possible to change the layout of the forms to fit the whole form on the screen at once, while still keeping with the websites theme. The only concern is that we would have to scale down the font sizes inside the form, and that could impact the readablility for some users.</p>
            <p>We also agree with the tester mentioning the scrollbar for the pizza and burger rows. Though we do not think that this scrollbar stands out way too much, there would be no harm in changing it to make it match the other colors, so that is definitely something we would do.</p>
            <p>Having a navigation icon in the footer beside the address is also something that should be implemented.</p>

            <h3>Regarding Usability</h3>
            <p>The critisism concerning not being able to click the email and address to be taken is understandable and we agree that this should be implamented, as it makes for a better user experience, adn makes it easier for users to communicate with Bowl-O-Rama.</p>
            <p>What we are not so sure about is the critisism we recieved regarding the merch items opening up another tab with a picture of the image. We do understand that some people may not like that approach, but we are not so sure if it should be changed or not. Some in our group agree with the critisism, and some like the original approach better. We feel like we would have to get more feedback regarding that specifically to be certain of which option to choose.</p>

            <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
            <p>After one project, four parts and a bunch of code, we are pretty much in unison that it has been a very educational experience. From a technical point of view, we would say that everyone has improved their competence in HTML, CSS, JS, GIT and programming as a whole. We found it rewarding to use our experience from lectures and assignments in practice and decide for ourselves what we wanted the end result to look like. We also learned a fair share about how to plan before a project, delegation of tasks and how to work as a group.</p>
            <p>On the other side we experienced that some members of the group had to put on bigger roles and more tasks than others, because of lack of experience and/or interest from the counterpart. We think it might have been easier for some to snooze during this project because of the insignificance the final assessment has on our final grade. The P2 deadline did also come a bit quick, and because of other mandatory activities taking up free time for some of us, some may have felt they couldn't contribute as much to the planning and envisionment of the product.</p>
