            <h2>Changes from concept</h2>

            <h3>Changes to intended CSS styling</h3>
            <p>All subheadings that were planned to have a font-size of 35 pixels were scaled down to 30 pixels as we felt that it fit better once we saw the site finalized, and that the original size was unnecesarily big. The footer headings were also scaled down, from 24 pixels to 18 pixels since it made room for the rest of the information without making the footer to large. All main headings were also made bold to naturally get the users attention.</p>
            <p>We decided to give the top of the header and the footer a background image blended into the red color as it made the site a little more interesting style wise, instead of just having it all be in red. We kept the red color of the header for the navbar since this would contrast better to the navlinks, and also to the rest of the page when you scroll down, since the navbar is sticking to the top of the viewport. We also made every page's header identical to the homepage since it makes for a more consistent design, and since we decided to go for a background image in the header, it wouldn't look that good if the other pages just featured a tiny part of the image.</p>
            <p>We ended up having several CSS files since it was easier to navigate smaller files and write each unique part of the site individualy without messing up somebody else's work. We put all the universal CSS in the styles.css, and all the uniqe to each page CSS in each of their own stylesheet.</p>

            <h3>Changes to homepage.html</h3>
            <p>The subheading "What We Offer" was aligned to the middle of the screen as it fit better with the rest of the content, which was already positioned in the center of the screen. We made the color of the text for each "What We Offer" card white so it better contrasted the background images. We also decided to make the background images blend in with a red color to match the color theme of the site. We made each card a little smaller so that the user didn't have to scroll unnecesarily far down to view everything.</p>

            <h3>Changes to prices.html</h3>
            <p>We ended up aligning the main heading of the page as we felt it fit better with the finalized page and matched the rest of the other pages's heading. The border radius of the images were increased from 5 pixels to 10 as that ended up being more pleasing to the eye. We also made the images disappear when the screen is 600 pixels or narrower, as it would just hinder the user from getting the information they are looking for.</p>

            <h3>Changes to reservation.html</h3>
            <p>We made some small tweaks to the form, that proved to work better than the mockup. Instead of just having a date reservation, we also put in a time input so that we could validate based on what hour the user chose. The "Special Requirements" area was made a little larger, and the submit buttom narrower as it was unnecesarily wide in the mockup. The submit button should still be very easy to locate, despite being scaled down.</p>

            <h3>Changes to menu.html</h3>
            <p>We increase both the border radius on the pink rows with food items inside, as well as the pictures of the food items themselves. Both increased from 5 pixels to 8 as we felt it gave the page a softer and more welcoming feel.</p>

            <h3>Changes to events.html</h3>
            <p>The individual event headings were scaled down from 35 to 30 pixels. We implemented javascript rewuirement number 1 in between the title and the description of each event, and added a background image relating to the event blended in with the sites red color. We also changed the text color inside of each event to white, to better constrast the background.</p>

            <h3>Changes to merch.html</h3>
            <p>The width of each merch item was decreased to not take up as much space. Each items border radius was increased from 5 to 8 pixels. We also left out the price of each item, as we felt if would just cludder up the space in each item.</p>

            <h3>Changes to about.html</h3>
            <p>We decided to make the page more interesting by making a javascript function that changes the background image behind the heading, instead of just having one static image the whole time. We also made the first image on the left move to under the first section of text when the page is scaled down, to make for a better user experience. Because of that, we also moved the second image all the way to the bottom of the about section so that the page didn't end up with two images straight after each other. The images's border size were double from 5 to 10 pixels. The whole about section were also narrowed a bit to make it easier for the user to perceive more of the page at once.</p>

            <h3>Changes to contact.html</h3>
            <p>We centered the heading and added some text meant to describe the different things the user could email the bowling alley about. A submit button was added to the form, as itw as missing from the mockup. The text with the contact info was made bold to draw the users attention towards it. The whole contact section were also narrowed to make it easier for the user to interact with.</p>
